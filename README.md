As we know Python is a suitable language for scriptwriters and developers. Let’s write a script for Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user’s need. 
Speech recognition is the process of converting audio into text. This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. Python provides an API called SpeechRecognition to allow us to convert audio into text for further processing. In this project, we will look at converting large or long audio files into text using the SpeechRecognition API in python.

# SpeechRecognition

Since we’re building an Application of voice assistant, one of the most important things in this is that your assistant recognizes your voice (means what you want to say/ ask). To install this module type the below command in the terminal.
pip install SpeechRecognition

# pyttsx3

This module is used for the conversion of text to speech in a program it works offline. To install this module type the below command in the terminal.
pip install pyttsx3

# subprocess

This module is used for getting system subprocess details which are used in various commands i.e Shutdown, Sleep, etc. This module comes built-in with Python. 

# wikipedia

 As we all know Wikipedia is a great source of knowledge just like GeeksforGeeks we have used the Wikipedia module to get information from Wikipedia or to perform a Wikipedia search. To install this module type the below command in the terminal.
 pip install wikipedia

# webbrowser
To perform Web Search. This module comes built-in with Python. 

# datetime
Date and Time is used to showing Date and Time. This module comes built-int with Python.

# os
The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python’s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality
